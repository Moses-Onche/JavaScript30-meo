# JavaScript30

JavaScript30 is a Javascript course developed and maintained by Wes Bos that guides participants to build 30 projects in pure javascript without any frameworks or libraries. The course is open to all levels of developers whether complete novices or seasoned developers.

I am taking the course so that I can solidify my understanding of javascript and how it applies to web development. It is also a way for me to practice, build my coding muscle and learn new things that may not have come across before. My solutions to each challenge will be linked below.
